# Start Pages
This is an ongoing collection of desktop startpages. They are designed for desktop browsers unless otherwise specified and will most likely not work on mobile browsers or resolutions. I plan on making these live sites soon so you can play around with them, so stay tuned for that.

Most of these are inspired by various Linux and Android home screen customizations, which is why you'll see a lot of flat colors, pixel fonts and big borders.
